# Colorado's Local Congressional Election Audit

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employees, Tom and Seth, has given us a data consisting of a number for the ballot ID and a name for the county and candidate, respectively. At this point, we don't know how many counties and candidates are in the file. Overall, the data appears readable and there are no unusual row values that we can see. We have been given election audit tasks to analyze the data and produce the election results to be presented to the election committee. We will be creating a Python code to analyze the CSV (comma-seperated-values) file to find the elections results. 

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.70.2
